# Workflow: Composites

## Purpose

Composite workflows consume prepared products to summarize event-centered
trajectories. They are workflows and diagnostics, not product stages.

## Primary Inputs

- Stage-1 harmonized regional time series
- event definitions and event-summary variables already present in Stage 1
- optional Stage-4 cluster labels when making cluster-conditioned composites

## Current Scripts

```text
scripts/plot_composite_timeseries_all.py
scripts/plot_composite_timeseries_split.py
scripts/plot_top_events.py
```

## Expected Behavior

- Open the Stage-1 product through the analysis-product IO layer when validation
  is needed.
- Use reusable event/composite helpers rather than rebuilding event IDs in the
  plotting layer.
- Align event-centered extracts on the documented event peak time.
- Render prepared composite data into figures without raw source loading.

## Outputs

Outputs are figures and diagnostic tables under `results/plots_*`. They are not
durable pipeline product stages unless a later implementation explicitly writes
and documents a composite dataset contract.

## Boundaries

Composite plotting should not perform raw loading, threshold generation,
harmonization, PCA fitting, or cluster assignment.
